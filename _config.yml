  learning from diverse subjects. Enjoy!

# TwoClicks metaphorically represents our human need to improve the accessibility of resources and tools with minimal hurdles as part of our evolution, thus this is my way to document my journey in doing the same. While this happens to be a generic blog
github_username: imakshayverma
# you can comment the below line out if your repo name is not different than your baseurl
github_repo: "blog"

# OPTIONAL: override baseurl and url if using a custom domain
# Note: leave out the trailing / from this value.
url: "https://imakshayverma.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com

###########################################################
#########  Special Instructions for baseurl ###############
#
#### Scenario One: If you do not have a Custom Domain #####
#    -  if you are not using a custom domain, the baseurl *must* be set to your repo name
#
####  Scenario Two: If you have a Custom Domain #####
# 1. If your domain does NOT have a subpath, this leave this value as ""
# 2. If your domain does have a subpath, you must preceed the value with a / and NOT have a / at the end.
#      For example:
#           "" is valid
#           "/blog"        is valid
#            "/blog/site/" is invalid  ( / at the end)
#            "/blog/site"  is valid
#            "blog/site"   is invalid  ( because doesn't begin with a /)
#
# 3. You must replace the parameter `baseurl` in _action_files/settings.ini with the same value as you set here but WITHOUT QUOTES.
#
baseurl: "/blog" # the subpath of your site, e.g. "/blog".
