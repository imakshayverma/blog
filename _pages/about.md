title: About Me
---

I am a technologist interested in building products and experiences around data. Have worked with for-profit and non-profit organizations in cross-functional roles, building applications that make data, information more accessible. I share some of my professional learnings in the blog. I am interested in how our society and humans function and thus I like to read and learn about a variety of subjects that help improve my understanding.

When it comes to my professional experience, I majorly had an engineering focus on general problem-solving. I have dabbled with Design and Consulting in conjunction with engineering. For engineering, I have majorly worked on two major focus areas - Full Stack Development and Data Engineering. Check my LinkedIn page to know more about my work.

I had worked on the OpenBudgetsIndia initiative. We build an open data platform in a single pizza team. One of the notable impacts that we were able to create was to bring policy level change at Assam government to publish budget data in an open, accessible format. Assam is currently the leading state when it comes to Budget Transparency and budgetary practices. I am also proud of other projects but sadly most of them are under NDAs.

I also share my knowledge at different platforms through conferences, workshops, seminars. I also took a 6-month semester university course as visiting faculty on Data Visualization. I am fascinated by the craft of teaching and it humbles me truly having taken sessions for a diverse audience ranging from School kids, Government bureaucrats, Master Students from different backgrounds, and people from the tech industry. During the pandemic, I have taken a small hiatus from active knowledge sharing. I hope to be back soon.

I am a big supporter of communities. A while back I used to run Googleâ€™s GDG community as a coorganizer to build help local enthusiasts connect, learn and collaborate with each other. It grew to become one of the biggest tech communities in Central India. I have also collaborated with Datakind Bangalore and Wadhwani AI on a bunch of non-profit projects.

I generally like to engage in conversations around food, society, and culture and hope to capture some of the interesting stories around it in the blog.
